Things to do:

*  profile/work-on efficiency
*  improve tests

-- bags/multisets

* rethink iterators
   -- need to iterate on the values in a collection
   -- need to iterate on the ds structure itself (the nodes) (for class changes)

-- conj for all the different data types (not just sets/vectors ... add to maps, arrays, lists)
-- cons for all the different data types (not just sets/vectors ... add to maps, arrays, lists)
-- contains? for all the things

-- find for maps: returns entire entry for k ?? do we really need this ??

-- add `for` macro
-- add `doseq` macro
