Things to do:

*  profile/work-on efficiency
*  improve tests

*  --- add subvec to get a slice of the vector

* rethink iterators
   -- need to iterate on the values in a collection
   -- need to iterate on the ds structure itself (the nodes) (for class changes)

*  add `for` and 'defund' (a destructuring version of defun?? (or defn?? ddefun??))

-- conj for all the different data types (not just sets/vectors ... add to maps, arrays, lists)
-- contains? for all the things
-- find (maps) returns entire entry for k ?? do we really need this ??

-- rseq ??

-- loop/recur (no need for recur on fns)
