Things to do:

*  profile/work-on efficiency
*  improve tests

*  --- add subvec to get a slice of the vector

* rethink iterators
   -- need to iterate on the values in a collection
   -- need to iterate on the ds structure itself (the nodes) (for class changes)

*  add clojure's destructuring if possible, then add `for` and `letd` (a destructuring version of let??) (or 'dlet' ??), and 'defund' (a destructuring version of defun?? (or defn?? ddefun??))
*

* hash maps need to be able to take 'nil as a value;
 -- right now the partition cons's the k with the nil which creates (k) rather than (k nil) :-(
