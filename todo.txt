Things to do:

*  profile/work-on efficiency
*  improve tests

*  --- add subvec to get a slice of the vector

* rethink iterators
   -- need to iterate on the values in a collection
   -- need to iterate on the ds structure itself (the nodes) (for class changes)

*  add `for` and 'defund' (a destructuring version of defun?? (or defn?? ddefun??))
*

-- redefine = as a defmacro????

-- conj for all the different data types
-- contains? for all the things
-- find (maps) returns entire entry for k

-- rseq ??

-- distinct
-- distinct?
-- dedupe

-- loop/recur (no need for recur on fns)
